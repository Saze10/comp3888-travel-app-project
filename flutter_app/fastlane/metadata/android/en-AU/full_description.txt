The goal of this project is to design and build a Web application and/or a native mobile application (android) that helps users to plan their daily trips. Users can create and update their profiles and specify their preferences. The users can select from where they would like to travel to a point of interest. The application finds and ranks all relevant point of interests and recommend different plans for the user. The application should also provide additional information to help the user plan for their trip. The user can save their recommended trips and share it with connected friends.
